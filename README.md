# Jamstack Explorers GraphCMS and SvelteKit

> Minimalist SpeceX website built with SvelteKit, Tailwind, DaisyUI,
> and deployed to Netlify.

## The stack

This is an example project using SpaceX API data in a GraphCMS schema.

- **[GraphCMS](https://graphcms.com)**: Manage mission and launch
  data.
- **[SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/)**: A powerful framework that
  lets us query data and use endpoints for server side data.
- **[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)**: For an intuitive Git based
  workflow with seamless publishing, instant cache invalidation and
  atomic deploys.

## How to use

âš TODO!

Rename the `sample.env` file to `.env` and add your own Content API
endpoint.

```bash
mv sample.env .env
```

Install dependencies and run local dev server:

```bash
npm i
npm run dev
```
